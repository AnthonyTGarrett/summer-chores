# Summer Chores

### Script to simulate doing summer chores with a chance of getting tired and giving up

- Set up all of the function to do the chores that I need them to do
- Linked them all to the next chore with a callback function
- Set up the outer function to call all of the inner functions

### Installation

- To run the script locally you should install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en)

### Usage

- Execute the script running 'node callbackVersion.js'
